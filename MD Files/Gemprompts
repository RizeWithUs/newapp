[[[please answer my question, then provide the 3 mAdd the navigation/sidebar styling next?

components organization:

frontend/src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/          # Shared components like buttons, inputs
│   ├── layout/          # Layout components like header, sidebar
│   ├── dashboard/       # Dashboard specific components
│   └── admin/           # Admin panel components
├── modules/             # Business logic modules
├── pages/              # Page components (routes)
└── features/           # Feature-specific components

 
Key Concepts:
Component Isolation: Each component has its own folder with all related files
Feature Modules: Related components are grouped into feature modules
Clean Exports: Index files make imports cleaner
Type Safety: Separate type definitions for better organization
CSS Modules: Scoped styling per component
Hooks: Custom hooks for reusable logic
