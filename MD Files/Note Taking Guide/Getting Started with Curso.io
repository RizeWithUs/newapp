## 1. Getting Started with Cursor.io
### Basic Setup
- Create a new folder
- Import MD (Markdown) files 
- Can copy files from Obsidian or other note-taking systems
- Preserve original files by copying rather than moving

_<u>Recommendation: Create a backup system before importing
files to maintain data integrity</u>_

### Why Use Markdown (.MD) Files?
- Provides structured data through hierarchy
- Works well with language models
- Renders nicely in various platforms 
- Uses headers (#) for organization levels

*Analogy: Think of Markdown like building blocks - headers are 
like different sized blocks that help organize your content, making 
it easier for both humans and AI to understand the structure.*
