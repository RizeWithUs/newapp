## 2. Project Organization
### Project Planning
- Start with a core project plan file
- Keep reference documents easily accessible
- Maintain clear project context

_<u>Recommendation: Create a standardized template for project plans...
...to ensure consistency across projects</u>_

### Context Management
Levels of context ("Aperture Control"):
1. Complete project scope
2. Document level
3. Paragraph level
4. Sentence level
5. Word level

*Analogy: Think of context levels like a camera lens - you can zoom 
in(word level) or out (project level) to get the perfect shot of information you need.*
