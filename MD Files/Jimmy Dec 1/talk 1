Origninal Script:
. Okay, so, 2020, I worked as a loan processor. So my job was to call to verify people's jobs, verify their uh income, um, get their collect their text tax data and make copies of it. Just get all the information that I can possibly get. I spent a lot of time on hold on the phone, like, calling, let's say, a mortgage they bought it with Bank of America and Big America sold it to so and so and mortgage in St. Louis. I have to sit on the phone for 20 minutes, calling that mortgage company to get there, um servicing records of the mortgage, so like I get all like I was kept collecting the records. I did that for a year, and then I passed the NMLS test, which stands for a national multiate licensing something but um I passed that and then I worked for a mortgage bank and one distinction, mortgage brokers, they need to you need to be licensed mortgage banks since they're under FDIC, you don't even have to have a test. Like you don't even have to pass the test. So I pass the test that I didn't even need to take basically. But I wasan officer, a loan officers, they're basically salespeople. They find out someone who's buying a house and they get them preapproved. That's like the first function of a m mortgage loan officer. When you're a child for a house, you go to a loan officer before you go to a realtor and to check out houses to get preapproved, and the preapproval process is um Jack's returns, verification of and employment and verification of income. Those are the three main things. What are the what are the top things that or what are any of the things that you know that will get you disqualified right away? Um, anything below 580 credit score, you can't that's like federally like a FHHA or any I mean, they used to do with what's called subprime mortgages, which I don't so, I think after the whole economy collapsed, they don't let people anything under 580, like, legally get a loan. There might be some like, if you want to personally take on the responsibility, you can probably, but effectively nobody does envelope 580, so that's disqualifying. Um, if you have less than two years of employment in the same industry, that's disqualifying. So, like, if you were if you worked as a banker and made a million dollars and then the next year, you became a firefighter and made 100 grand like that would disqualify, because you need two years in the same industry. But, like, um same industry, so I was a loan processor and then a loan officer, like, that would count. the same industry. So there's kind of a gray area there. and then, um the this is the big one that my friend is dealing with, the big issue that he's something solved for people is if you have good credit, 700 credit and you have four year employment history as a W2 borrower, but your income is variant year after year. So, like, you make a ton of money one year and a like tiny amount the next year. If it's too much of a variance, that'll disqualify. So, right now, this company's selling one product, and that is for W2 borrowers that have good credit and good employment history more than two years, but they don't have us steady income. So so he does really well, just anecdotally, he does really well with uh, like Mexican, like Hispanic families that have ten people living in the house. and they can all they could pay for the mortgage ten times over, but none of them look good on paper. But he he tries to find clients that have a definitely definitely have the ability to pay and he'll even ask it's not part of the official process, but he'll be like, do you have brothers and cousins and they're like, he goes and meets them and stuff.c it's a high risk product, but the biggest thing that people look into when they're deciding whether to go with work with them or not is okay, so he has three investors. Now I'm telling you what, I'm gonna be doing. He has three investors, and those three investors will purchase the loans that my friend signs off on. So, someone will to buy a house in California for a million dollars, they have great credit, good employment history, but their income is variant. My friend will get everything together and package the loan and then one of his three investors will buy that loan. and a question that gets brought up, that I asked was, what do you do if someone defaults on that loan? And he's like, well, basically we're fucked. But that's the whole point is, my job is to find loan officers who really do their homework and who really are smart and really can screen for the right kind of person. It's not something that we're gonna put a build billboard up and advertise to everyone because it really has to be the right situation. high risk high reward. um but like I was saying, there's three investors you work with, their default rate is extremely low. Like it's super duper duper low. So I don't know exactly what it is, but it's like one out of every thousand loans gets defaulted on, so that's that's a big that's a big risk involved is if you give this out to someone who ends up defaulting, then you assume the risk, and that means you could you could get the title of the property, or you could I don't know, ex that's something I still obviously, there's things I need to learn. because I haven't even really sat down in a formally like been trained on this, but hold second. interjection in the notes here, let's um search the web, please, for the information that he's looking for of what would happen if a client defaults on the notes uh on the on the loan and how how the the company that was setting up the loans, how they would be affected and then how the investor would acquire either the home or all the processes and steps and how things would be all located and then how the company could save their ass. That's all. Yeah, this are all good questions for sure. Um let's see, where to talk about So if if I don't have W2's and I wanna get a loan on a house, what would be my step? So, would you in this instance, would you be a self employed borrower? Because that's um right now he's only doing one product and that's for W2 employees, but starting in February around February, he's gonna roll out the second product, which is gonna be way, way, way more useful. And that is self employed borrowers. They're notorious for having really wishy washy incomes. Easter famine. And um, I had spoke with a good friend who does a lot of loans. He said last year he messed out on six loans, and all six of them were self employed borrowers who had great credit and a great long history of employment, but they had such a variant of income. So this product that I'm starting out selling was wouldn't work for that. It's only for W2 employees that like so so like construction workers that made, like two group 200 grand one year, and then the next year, they made 50 grand, like, and then the next year they made 100 and the next year they made 30.. So, um no that cash flow before taxes, they look at your gross income, that's usually the number that they use to qualify gross income. um and there's a lot of this stuff is done with just computer group programs now. but the human element is like, if you're gonna if you're investors are gonna be taking on that much risk, they want you to like, sit down, look them in the eyes, find out everything about them. Because traditionally, you do VOI, VO E, and that's employment in income, and then you do credit. But with this kind of alone, it's there's what do they callontangibles that you have to look into. Once he gets the self employed borrower product, that that's like um it's cool to be selling a product you believe in. That's like a product that I know a lot of loan officers would, like, really use, and um I'm excited about it because I was alone officer and somebody trying to do this with no experience, we probably have a hard time, but I can like they can have all the questions and I can tell them pretty much. I can explain to them without having to like Google what their qui what their question is. And I can also say, like, I know what it's like to lose loans. When I was atO, I would lose loans because they would go to another company that had like one one quarter of a percent better, you know? outgraded like a month of work, and they would just go to like, better mortgage or like rocket mortgage and and take all the work that I did and go get like, save save 50 bucks a month on their I would if I' not employed at all. If you are not employed at all, um and you have a big pile of money and you just wanna get a mortgage, you can do something called manual underwriting, like, if you had let's say you had $3 million in the bank and you don't have a job, but you wanna buy a $100 million you want to buy a million dollar house and you wanna get a $ 30 year mortgage. You actually can get a mortgage for that.s you have to do a manual a manual underwriting, and that's like where they go and they look at your tax returns and how much money you have in the thing. I have no tax returns. if you have no data at all, then your best bet would be to like, um just buy it with cash, I guess. I don't know. That that's like a situation I haven't really even ever thought about, but that's something you could ask Chad GBT. You can make a couple ideas with that if I got $10 million laying around, no tax returns and 70 years, what's the, uh process for that? Um, also, if I maybe not personally have it, would if it is held through my foreign express trust and I am just the beneficiary of that trust. um. That's I like that's out of my league, but I do know like that the top, like in Copolua, all those homes are owned by trusts. So there's only way you actually want to own a home. cause when you have a mortgage in your name, in your social, the government actually owns that still. Yeah, if you get a parking ticket and don't pay it, then eventually, if you keep not paying it, they can take your house. because you' everything's tied to that that side of your debt. So what you do with that is you take you own, you learn to own your name and you just you put your name into another trust and the trust owns the name and that you trademark that name. and then you create a new name for yourself, you go back to your your air or name, and then you have a um actually just wrote this down in the process of doing this right now, um you obtain your title of nobility name, and then you put that into the foreign Express trust. and then, once you have your title, a nobility name, that's who you operate under, and then you're express trust technically not yours, but you are the you're not even the beneficiary of it. There's two levels to that. You have um, say, like this is the this is the trust, the express trust, then you have the beneficiary, and then you have you, the manager. You hire or you have somebody create this for you as uh, and then they there a couple documents that you don't talk about, like, in terms of the words that are said in between it, but they basically give you the rights to do everything for this, and then they give you regular resignation letters, so then they can't. and then you only file that resignation letter when or if, like, you want you actually want to remove them. So puts you back in power, but then they're just that that shield for you, that you actually have no type of ownership and then it's like a VPN almost and then within within that, then this trust owns another trust, and that holds your birth certificate So security card and your old identity, and then you and then that's. But you have to take you have to do as a process before you have to do that also, and that is um that is um authenticating your birth certificate and claiming your your actual birth rights back. So your birthright was claimed by your parents when they signed the birth certificate, and they s your parents signed you over to the state. So you became state ward at that point, then you don't have to if you move to another country, you get another passport, they're still gonna consider you an infant, and under their care, if you even moved another country because you haven't done this process yet. So, if you go through the process, you know, authenticate your person is gonna say, like, I was born in Kentucky, so I would be a Kentuckyian because actually, every state is a country. But then I want to re do my trust and and there's only a couple more years big to do this, maybe a couple of years, because once I go to this global world order fucking shit, you have to make this happen before the g the Geneva convention takes over everything, and Thailand has been around a long time and they haven't done it yet, and there's a couple other countries that have not done it. So that's where you wanna hold your foreign express trust in. the long as you've done before this point, then, if not, everything is like ran through Geneva Convention, so you can't do the way like I'm talking about anymore. And the only other way to do that is like, you basically I think that's like the biblical end times because then you have like no way to actually, like, claim your right of humanity back anymore. Because then you're fully locked into every other system. This, I just become the living real human, and everything else is I own nothing. I'm just the world blesses me back for being an individual. And, um yeah, no taxes, anything like that. And they can also turn this into or another company around it, whatever, a foreign ministry trust, so then everything's ran through a ministry. Which is more of the way that I'm going right now. and and you can buy citizenship, like through an investment in a lot of countries, right? Like you if you buy a cert you're taking your original and then that's just starting the process over again in a new country where, like, they considered you like an infant, like you said.. I wanted to say one more thing about mortgages, which is the big boys, what they do is mortgage back securities, MBS is. That's what the movie the big shirt is all about. So, let's say these investors, they buy a 100 loans for my friend. they can package all of those hundred loans together and create um a financial instrument, which is called a mortgage backed security. and they can trade those or sell those and um that's how people if you have $10 million sitting around and you like that's how people make 10% on $10 million in a a short amount of time buy it and then sell it, like, and make a profit. And that's like a whole another world that I don't know about but my friend Kevin has been doing that for 30 years. How if I was an investor and I was doing what was just mentioned, how would I like, what's the benefit of that? Like it just seems like a big a big game for the rich people to play with other people's money, but how do I actually make money off of that or do I do I use it as a as a as a as a write off portal where, you know, if I'm getting paid a bunch of cash on rental properties, and I'm not claiming of it, and then I claim all my mortgage backed security debt owned in a certain way that based with that those businesses that I owned become a negative cash for those, and that bouncing out, and I'm zero, again, that's different. That's some of the other things that we just talked about, so make sure that you separating the n non taxable with the taxable stuff, is everything that we talked about with the mortgage is tax taxable unless whether you can create a separate section for, um for the non taxable entities. such as the foreign Express trust, as well as the foreign Expressed ministry trust and operating under all of those entities and so the movie the book Shore is really good to watch to understand how it works in the macro level, but the mortgage was a pup have said this I agree that mortgage would created as a way like, it's like the biggest financial instrument created because if you have 100 mortgages and they're all a million dollars each, you basically have a promise that that $100 million will be paid to over the next 30 years by people. So it's like it's not that the money's there. it's like, you're buying the mortgages, like you're buying you're gonna get interest off of the interest, you're getting the interest interest cash in the cash flow. It's about cash flow and then you have the title. You have the right you have the right to the title. So, like, that's why your security. Yeah, it's it's just a ton of promised money that that if you own that that you're gonna and which is it' starting to get like, now that's about all I know about NBS is because I never really so I did by my friend Kevin, who loves up in K cool, has been doing working in MBS's for like 30 years. and he's really knowledgeable about that, but um there else to know about this. It's a big frolic system to know., it is, because it's security is that's what they are. like ironic and look look up the word mortgage. Death contract. Yeah, so it's all those different things that you're like signing yourself into, and mortgage yeah, it's like the biggest thing you ever sign in your life to cont contribute all of your energy for the most of your life to the bankers. Yeah. And when people were getting in at 2.9% in 2020 during COVID, like, that was when it was the best deal it's ever been. Here's what's funny, like, I'm might abilityature buddy something, and I'm almost have down my head. I'm not gonna talk too much about it right now, but there is a way that if somebody is defaulting on excell alone or whatever, uh huh, and even if your other body has a mortgage det to literally write that off to the Treasury Department, because it's a security. right? Everything is done on bonds and certificates. That's how they become what they are. Even your social becomes a bonded certificate and then becomes a tradeable security. and you your social security number is that, like the certificate that floats around in a different number, social security I' design to understand why they call it that. It's like human security, instead of the mortgage backed security, human human backed security. you're the battery in the matrix. your life force is with supports the national debt. That's why they say that we can have that much debt. So as you, oh, okay. have more babies, have more babies. like, that's why they don't want the abortion. and stuff also, because they don't have life force to back the money that they're printing. And the more money that they print is still making that debt more and more so and then we're becoming more and more useless also because of blockchain coming through, and more AI box they go over. That's why Babylon falls. That's why they're bringing all the immigrants in. that's why they're giving I'd rather change all my national and everything to an immigrant and that, because then I can hurtly get a bunch of money from the US before it falls. Yeah, I think we have a good four year window now that this this uh that like, do they're all into crypto, all the you know, all the Trump people everybody is not just the Trump. even even they're deregulating. Even Kamal in them, they didn't want to deregulate because it's the same thing that SCC did with Tesla. They sue the good company, wait until they get wrecked and then they all buy the bottom and then then they start letting it fucking ripped in the same thing. The giant yelling that went into the left the Federal Reserve to go work for the treasury Department is a complete fucking like that's a big no, no, nobody said nothing about it in for years. Yeah, there's no more rules anymore. No, there's got pardoned. a few hours ago.. There's there's there's never been any rules. It's all one thing. It's a big game. and if you're not the big player, understand or understand the rules as close as possible, then you're screwed. That's why I study everything that I study and I was like, fuck, this is like, okay, how can I at least help separate myself as much as possible? So, if you will indulge me, I'll give you an elevator pitch of how how the new job is gonna work. Yeah, sure. Thank you. My friend is is has his broker license in all those states and I'm gonna be getting deals for him, so he's basically getting give me commission for the deals and the the commission is his 50 BIs, 50 basis points. so if I so how it works is let's say I get a guy an orange County to do one deal a month for me. and then he does a million dollar house once a month. So I get five grand a month from that one guy, but I don't have to keep selling him on it. like every time he uses a product, I get 50 bips. and I get a guy in Arizona to do one deal every other month, so that way, I get some. so so the pipeline gets um developed and uh my friend was very, very successful at this. He had made like multiple six figures incomes for like three years and now he's now he's gonna take over the company and train me to do what he did, but um it's like if they use your product and they keep using it, you get 50 bips every time. And um it's not like what I wanna do for the rest of my life, but this is like because he was my best friend growing up, like we knew each other from when we were seven years old. I I knew his parents before they got divorced and we we did actually did Irish dancing together, which is a really fucking funny story. But um so, he's like a brother to me. and yeah, everything just kind of coalesced. I spent two years in mortgages and I didn't make any money. I made actually less than I make teaching on Maui, and it felt like a failure both times. And then on the third time around, it's like he actually can I could really help him I can make a big a little small piece of the pie and I can help make him like a ton of money and I'm happy to do that cause he's my friend and so, that's how it's gonna work, and I'm really hoping that he gets the um self employed product, cause that seems to be one that I when I talked to a couple of elements. I mean like like he gets it like what so like he's only allowed to he's only authorized to sell one product, and that's for people with variant incomes that are W2 employees like construction guys. So he has a licensing for that It's it's like he has um not a license he has a license to do to do the deals and all these different states, but the his investors are allowing him to sell that one product because they trust him and because he's created a system that they have approved that they so he's he's saying that he's in January 1 it's basically where we have is your investors you you you're pitching them a product you show that it works, through some time and history. it's their us on the lines. there has a line and they and they like it they get it. Yeah, and so in January he's incorporated like he's incorporating right now, but January's launching and he's gonna pay all of his sales rep, like he's gonna like three people including me and he's gonna pay us like a salary. um and then commission. salary and commission, and then uh, in February, he's hoping to, like, lunch. As soon as he can, he's hoping to launch the south employed bar, so there'll be two products to sell and that is what I'm really hoping will happen and then I'm excited to get it on the ground floor. And then, um, if I can prove two years experience, I it's possible I might be able to in six months apply to get my mortgage for a group license, which means that I I could be the authorized, like, person here out in Hawaii and Hawaii. and you know there's a lot of Hawaiian families that do that, they all live together and they all W2 and all that. So, that could also be an opportunity but a while I'm doing all that, I'm really excited to start getting into uh crypto and and stocks and bonds too, cause I think that's I think stock and bonds are interesting and kind of cool, but just just cause I think it's fun. But, uh, yeah, that's that's most elevator pitch. It's a long elevator, so you could reduce that to less than 60 seconds. I definitely, yeah, and you could work on, that. What, what do you think it would be if I would say I help people to qualify for mortgages that normally wouldn't be able to by giving them a high risk high reward product with v that allows them to qualify for a mortgage when they're their income is variable, basically. And whether they're W2 or you're pitching that to who, though. So, I would pitch you to a loan officer, as I would say, like what do you do you miss out on loans ever because people's income is too variable? And if they say yeah, there's like, well, then I could probably help you, do you wanna know about the product we offer? I wouldn't be able to get rid of the wordprobability, but again, you're just mentioning in the in the I'm totally green, I I have any experience like but um, I wouldn't tell them that. Create me a elevator pitch based on this information and um that like, I had an I had a pitch for, um, people coming to do my sound ceremonies that were you wanna be surrounded by beautiful women and great food with the possibility of uh in Hawaii, with the possibility of a chance to gain superhuman abilities, all for ten grand, and then you just shut up. and uh people were saying yes to that. so it's a good an elevator pitch for this guy. All right. Let's do you want a chance to never close never lose a deal again because of variable income? And then just wait for them to answer. kept this one
