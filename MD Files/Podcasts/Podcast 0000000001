Today is 741 PM, November 29th. Friday. And I'm here with Oodi O Oini, my weenie baby. I think that's what he is in my songs. I don't even know how that happened, but we're here and we're chatting about our existence as humans and our um like life goals and our in our kindmanship to God and understand who we are. others. recognized Christ. And the only way that we can and the only way that we can do that is be be the light and be the fisherman, but you become the fisher of men by being the light. That's that's really it. So um yeah. So I uh step one, recognize my mistakes, was gonna up in the morning. We don't call out people would call them up. um so and then that back to that as a leader, your weakness is their way out. as a leader, your weakness is though every little thing that I do wrong, micro or not. People are fucking pulling out. It's like I know there are some things in my life. Like I don't mind a little bit that like in the background, like lightly, like this needs to be more and more like only for like that's it. Like I need to keep my word and use it only for, you know, building things. Like if I need to to get high to go out and have fun, everything in life's gonna get really fucking boring really quick, you know?uce. So, also for me right now, having fun coming to this point of understanding, like a certain lifestyle that I want to live, having fun for me is growing my business, but when I think of it as my business, I think as myself and my brand and me. Like, I have to grow on me. I have to be it better than me. I have to be a better at me to be in the frequency that I want to receive the things that I want to receive, to be able to take care of the people I want take care of. you know, like my relationship with Hayley has, you know, kind of like maybe it feels that sometimes like it's falling well, it feels like sometimes it like it's going apart, but really it's like, it's only becoming better. I'm like, you do whatever you want, like if I need your help, I goll ask what do you wanna do it, but also do the things that you love to do, but I'm here to take care of you, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not I'm not like I'm not worried about chasing some girls, some pussy, like I'm just like, yeah, I mean, sure some fun here and there on the side. Like it's it's a thing, but it's not any of my main priorities. like, going out looking for you to go and dress to and press, like go socialized chat like, there's no what are you partying for right now? You have nothing that you want in your life for the most part, right? Like, you're failing with this mind that you have, you're failing with this mind that you have, like, and you work in a nine to five job and you can be opening your own business, creating your own fucking thing, doing all these other things. like, sit there, find your fucking space and make that space, and that's what I'm trying to help people get to go do. So, that's why I'm sitting here with you going over this, because I also want to do that for you, and you're one of the few people that I want to sit with and talk with and um build my capabilities on by also building your capabilities on. I'm giving away free knowledge that I already have myrices set on these courses. I got like from $3000 to to to $90,000. I'll go live in with somebody for 21 days and we'll be there fucking tie myself to their fridgeage and not let them in there so let night snaps. you know, like the whole nine, like, I've already been structuring this for a while, so and this is the best way to also do this, is talk more, because you get to see how you communicate and what comes about, what else is needed and then, um because I don't really set this up as a session, like, that's what we'll see we'll do that the next time right now, is sort of like bans turn back and forth a little bit, let's see, you know, what what opens up, and um where the fuck I'm at anyway. Another thing, so we were just talking about as a leader, your weakness is their way out. So it's like, where are you looking we get? You getting angry, you get emotional, never respond to any of them with emotion, never. I've done it and it only puts you on that field, so then it turns into a hair nail pulling battle. So it doesn't go anywhere. love that is cradled in wisdom. That's all it is anyway, so but I like to separate that because in those moments, the all of the triggers that do pop up, regardless, because you want to you want to keep your crown on, you right? That you're like, I'm the fucking I make the calls around here, but if you're making fucking bad calls,eated like they're gonna reason to call you out. Like, I let her call on some things and I'm just like, you know, we talk to you about my my fault my shortcoming. It's like, the other day it was like talking about uh, she's making all these meals and stuff like that. I' like, Dan, look at you getting all these things done and look at me. with all these fucking 90 one% complete projects. you know? Like, and getting, you know, it's like, yeah, anyways, so there there's a way like you've only got two hundreds and I've got 47 projects that are donate 30%. yeah, so it's like so then looking at those things, then and then opening those doors, it' be like, okay, I'm comfortable, I can laugh about it, but really I'm angry about it. And I want the change. but I'm gonna laugh it off with you and let you have your moment of happiness, but really, this is what's going on inside of me as a man and my the position role that that I chose to be here and be this person me before I came, and that's what we're here for. We're not none of us are equals, all this fucking equal rights, liberty rights, bullshit. Tell me how tell me how the man that's my exact age standing right in front of me can bench press two and more pounds of me, has five world titles, runs 50 businesses, a billionaire, and I live in a shed. I live in a shed with 46 felonies. keep nothing in my name, which is one of the smart things. Thank goodness that I do. and I'm supposed to we're supposed to be heatful. No, I fucked off. I understand that now. No, I now I changed. I become better. I become a reflection that I wanna be, right? So there's anger behind that, but I'm using that anger, I'm turning that anger in a love. and I'm I have that wrote out here. Most people do not change until they're in a position they're socomfortable and they's that they hit the bottom. Yeah, you got hit rock bottom to change. when you are thrust out of your comfort zone, that is when you make real change. And I am wanting to shift away from that into changing because you are comfortable I want to get away from the negativity and the hatred and just using all the all the rage as fuel and getting just back into not changing because you are at peace. at peace, you are more open to the understanding yourself and your environment and understanding each other. Yeah. But I look at it also it's it's it's very true as we sit here and talk and there's a very deep feeling of say, I say yes, I understand, but I also say no, I say I like change because you are comfortable. I don't like comfort. I've come out here and I sleep on the floor just to be uncomfortable and just to be like, you deserve this because you know, you wanna be in the place, you wanna be in, boom. then once second get my nice bed one night, you know, I' let's sleep in my nice fucking fine million house in bed and fucking whatever, you know, and enjoy some of my things, but then also watch that enjoyment. Like I always like be looking for the uncomfortable, right? Be and then driving that space would be like, I know I could be more. I know I could be this without this like, um and I don't have it as a knee to be better than another man. I have it as a kn need to be like, man, I just know that if I am this that my influence on others for for a better purpose, because the frequency that I want to fucking vibrate in, the world that I want to be in, this is not it. ran by a bunch of fucking demonic fucking pedophiles for the past how many of years, you know, it keeps looping around to that, so it's like because people fall for, you know, the shit in this in this world and they fucking any who, it's um that right there which you're talking about. to be falls more in line with training training or soa, like you putting position in the position so that you are training yourself to be able to be more adaptable and more Everything that comes at you is training. so this we live in the fucking matrix video game. It's all training. It's all your game. Everything around you is this like okay. I'm in this fucking space because these are the these are the problems that I need to go through. Now can I can I go through them very stoically in a way that like in the way that I take care of those and I beat the light around me, you know? But now you know, there's these like some people that I met, like in the joint. I'm doing three triple lives for murder, and I'm fucking 18 years old. You're gonna give a fuck about what you're saying about being the light? Like, I wanna go kill some more. I might just wanna kill you. Watch out when you go to child. Okay. nice talking with you. Thanks for thanks for listening. Thanks for communicating back with me how you feel. You know, like there is that balance of this space in this place. It was like so I was there, I went through that, and I'm in another frequency no space. It's like it doesn't mean that it's all it's not gonna be out there to be in that space because like those battles is just like the battles of Job, like where we're going through in our world right now is are happening. All the things might be so great, and then all of it just stripped right from you again. Who and how will you be? Will you understand what what the play is, the theatric. So what I was getting at was that was the theatrics. The uh tricks, the theatrics of of of your character. So depending on how influential you want to be or like, what level of light you want to produce, right? It's gonna be in the theatrics of your character. Life for you, you have you have a name, and now you have a story, or even a bigger story, and and you have a good voice, but it's like if you want more followers and you want to be a fisherman, you can't just throw your I'm I'm gonna be humble and throwing my humble net on the people like get a following and get consciousness to follow you, it your your people. So like, I'm not just changing for me. I'm changing for my people. Well, for my people. you for the for all of you. For all of me, which is me, I am all. So it's like but either again, it's like, well, I need more of me to follow me. I need more neur to connect, I need more neurons out here to be no neurons like me, so how do I do that? I can't be just like this in the corner. I need to put some tone behind it. I need to let anger. I need to let anger come out in a way that is, peaceful. I need let anger like use the emotions as another way to deliver energy and be more theatrical in your character, and I've heard that throughout the time but I never really put that together through people like man, you to be in a mood for you a fucking comic book character or Johnny Bravo vibe, or like all these like characters, like always get something from somebody like very randomly. This one girl at an art mixture is like, wow, you got this like whole Mickey Mouse by, I'm like, thank you, I don't really know, you know. And it was just like you know. she had this like taken a bad moment, like she wanted to slightly offend me because I felt there was an attraction to me, right? And then I turned in an eye and she's like, oh, oh. I'm like, yeah, okay, you can feel that way.D d d. And then all a sudden, you know, like she was just like trying to be nice again. It's like, damn, you just try to put me down so I can me down, like, be in that space, but, you know, talking about the way I look is what I was wearing or whatever I was like, okay, you know. And completely twisted that to be the character because it's all theatrical. So be a person by the words we's it. or we're doing both of the same time. in all 12s to 12, the densions mentionion. And when you words tentions, it's very. Yeah. I just keep your word yourself. so let's go through some more here. We'll do a couple of them and then see where we'll just we go stir the pot. So be congruent and align with your heart. That's what we're just saying, right? Be cruin a line with your heart. Line up and match up. Jesus, they will try to stop you when you're the light and will try to turn you off and they'll try to stop you no matter what. Look at the lights that they went through. They're like they try all these other things and stop, you know? Like, even to doing what they did, but that's because it's truth and truth hurts. and they don't wanna hear and they don't wanna feel it. So there's a certain way you call up people and you call them out. Don't overdress your thought, your thoughts and fine language. So I I talked about what I say before about pick a couple of things that you could say when you're thinking weird, you know, or I'm not even thinking we're just connecting to the weirdness of I could be doing this, I could steal this, I could take this, I could talk like this. I don't need to think like that, just tell yourself, you need you guys get all out, I don't need to think like that. If somebody ask you what you thinking about, be like, I don't even need to talk about what I need to think about because as long as you need to be in that frequency. Like, no, nothing. Blink blink can change your mind. Blink. What was that? Blink can change your mind. Blink and change your world. I am the problem. You gotta want it. I oh, I earn is not forged in comfort. Don't fake it, make it asthough people like,ake it until you make it. like, no, don't fucking fake it, make it. like make it your character. What your character, who are you? Be that be congruent, be align with your heart. So, don't be a person of too many words, and too many deeds. that's who I felt that I wasoming out of these. pull back some my deeds and give it like to like validation, like feel to be good, like feel good, like, no, I don't know who I am and who I need to be now, and like and I just break that now I need to really shape the character and then be that character. Then that's I'm only shaping the character that I'm becoming the man that I admire that I never had in my life, and then becoming the best version of that that I can be and then gifting that back to the world. is the world of myself. It's a very selfish motive, but this hard as selfish part is right now because 90% of people run away and I don't want to be around you. You're too truthful and it hurts too bad.. And that's okay. And you step away from that, because those aren't know how to open the box to look inside of that. Well, that's what I'm here for, now. I'm here to help them open the box. That's why I've plan on using some of this and some other medicines and my my chanting itself to help take people to those spaces. and sometimes it's a fucking, you know, complete opposite, like people go fucking like we can you're a perfect instcts. After you part a couple of times and we't ceremized, like, you went to some spaces, like life was fucking weird and all of a sudden it went depressed. Like, you go down that fucking hole, but just like you didn't want to have to do that, like go to your lowest spot, like, it was good for you, right? You went through the fucking shit and you made it out. you beat it, and you got to go fucking cruise some fucking beautiful Lassie again. and now you're back fighting this other shit again where it's just like, okay, but I remember wrote some of things I was telling you about. Wait, you're not.m over.mame same thing, like it just it's you're beating it, it's like I already won this fight, but I see what I was also doing in my character in in inens. like when when I called you off a few times with some shit you were doing. I was like, you can't be that frequency if you want you want to keep that change, right? And it's just like that thing, so, but you were exactly right, too. You already knew it, but calling each other up in a way. So that's been my way is like how can I communicate call up, if I want to call Hayley up on something, like, I have to do it in a certain way, but at the same time, I don't because I'm out of the person feelingings. You don't wanna be around me, that's okay, you know, it'll happen for a little bit. But then you'll wanna be around me again. so I'm figuring out a way that I could say that now, like I'm gonna say something hurtful, I'm gonna say somebody like, as they're walking away or they're like, might not be around me right now, but you will wanna be around me and again, because you're gonna see what real love is. Like, that's really it, you know? It's like finding finding ways to be able to use my position of authority as the figure I am now. like I have an authoritative visual representation and it can be even better, and I know that also. Like I know I could work on my physique more I I've work on other things to be this magnet that draws people in to save the light be the light, but my light can't just be this fucking bright thing they can't look at cause they'll turn away. I I need it to I need it to I needed it to kind of I need to go like this when you talk to me, you't to like this and I change with see you you know, it's it's more of if you're being a light, you gotta kind of put a put a dimmer switch on it and some colors and play that role, so that's again with theatrics, like. I like the more animal kingdom for me, like it's easier way to think of it like gonna find a way to be that candle that one little candle in the stadium, that draws them in and the closer they get to it the briber gets. I don't wanna go to the candle, though. I don't want to be the candle. Maybe you wanna be that right now, I I wanna be the fucking I wanna be the peac I wanna be the peacock. you realize it a candle it's the. I want to be this fucking they think I'm fucking blitz out of my mind P God, but I'm just high on fucking life right now being full of love and then my theatrics draw them in to this character that called them out for being a fucking deooseback piece of shit and I still love you. It's it's time to change, though, buddy. You could be better, not just for you for your kid. all those things. So that's why I don't wanna be a little fucking candle something can kick over. I We have bold commonent characters, not to be some fucking humble giants that's fucking hot out in the caves. Like we got some purpose to do. so be that purpose, who do you fucking wanna be you could be out of the fuck you wanna do, wherever you go right now. Doesn't matter who knows you right now or not? Look look at CO and all the other bullshit, right? Like how fast people' mindoop yes, hoop up like whoever you are to anybody else right now is a is irrelevant, it will only matter about who you continue to show yourself as from every moment forward from now. That's it. Every fucking time. Then over time, that other like, wow, I really see who you're being right now. You're probably gonna get some people that walk up to you and say like, say these, you know, say these extra things. Got communicate more differently. You gotta do things differently. People say this around you and be like, yeah, let's you know. I'm just walking away because I don't wanna be around a bunch of gossip. and they're gonna be like, well. like, you know you just like you call him out a little bit, but call him up a little bit, right? Well, hey, let let' let's talk about some higher vibational things right now. There's certain things about I will still call some people out in in certain context, though I think that that should be taken into effect. I'm not gonna get too d down. I believe I want at least finish this fucking one page of notes here. let's hit. So theatrical, make make a fucking character be the character when problems arise, I prove to myself who I am because I can solve any fucking problem that comes at me, adversity introduces a mad to himself, adversity, introduces a a problem will show you who you really are, and awareness tells yourself to shut up, not just your mouth when you're either overapologizing or you're over analyzing your or you're overeaining to do something, it just awareness tells yourself, just shut up and observe the situation that people because you also put yourself in a situation to be it's like, you you the cross has already been barren. you don't have to bear it again. There's a way to do it and get to people and change their hearts and their minds by sometimes just being quiet and as being being a presence, you'll you'll know the right moment is, you know, speak up or take action or listen to your telephone for Okay, um so love is an uprequency, anger is a lower frequency, but when you accept your anger and you love it and you could turn it around and then turn it into a loving frequency, right? Use it as how I express a few times already. Get some of the gems, get some of your quotes. um some other quick tips, go murder our workout when you're scrolling on Instagram or your fucking just kind of sitting like what am I gonna do with my day? Go fucking murder a workout. Just go do it one side push up to even say you can't fucking do more. and then go do it and then do it again, give yourself like a two or three minute break, and then do it again, do three or four times. Then you if you get down to two pushups, cool, great. Then go see how you're feeling about yourself, because don't decide who you are when you're feeling in those states. decide who you are after you become more aware, because you're asking yourself more, define your you're defining yourself in, you, a higher frequency, because if you're frequently seeing all of this other shit on Instagram, it's not you in other life, then you wanna be living, you right? It's sucking you about you. That's gonna be that so and that's not really your frequency. It's gonna be like, damn. So it's feeling it's putting you in that down state. So, go change your frequency. We get yourself back in your high frequency, feel strong, good and good, and then get in that space. and the last one was I'm gonna go to that one later seven days. So in the first through third dimensions as we sit now that get flumpet. Oh, An ego needs to be the servant of the soul. An ego needs to be a servant of the soul. You create a relationship with your soul. Your ego's here for a purpose. You only ego's just be like, look at me. I'll fucking got this. I'll do this. I'm d d. There there's nothing that needs to be said, there is just doing that needs to be done, and then love that needs to be expressed. By doing that, you're starting to make the eagle to servant of the soul. It accepts that. You could when it feels like it wants to take control, you just say like, do you wanna look a certain way? Like, you can have your little you can have this, but today, like, this is who we're going to be because my consciousness, my soul, my higher self is this is who we are. You push through whatever you feel and you go be this be this thing. There's certain times a tune in yourself, but if you're tuning out by tuning in something else, you're not tuning in, because you're tuning into their frequency, not you. So don't be distracted, tap in, tie yourself. um I am here now. Yeah, I'm it's they'll definitely shape you. I am here now. I am here now, I am here now. It is easy to get in the future in the past. Oh, I did this, this happened to me, I was this person. It was like when we were talking about me getting my doctor a degree or my PhD. By the way, I'm gonna be a doctor pretty soon and a PhD. d d I'm fucking smart and I'm fucking brand Why? Because I listen to within. not from without. And I'm not talking about those crazy fucking twisted fucking watching fucking tell it Tubby's fucking jacking off with a wet sausage wrapped around my meat nights. That's weird, but you know. sometimes sometimes it's gotta happen. sausage. I've heard the dry sausages would the better than So, um I am here now, so you you're you are as your soul a descended master that needs to learn to tame the ego and then the ego becomes a servant of the soul. The ego is not equal to the soul just like every man and every woman is not equal. They try create this fucking bullshit and now look at the bullshit that happens when they try to are equal rights are this, are that. Like sure, you can vote, you can do these other thing, you get like all those things are available, but there's still some things that everybody has a role in a place for. like, I still one of my biggest ones is like, some judges might be mad at me for this, but I still don't think women should be judges because of their emotional uh emotional logic. They are very smart and they came up and really great inventions and there is some superiority in their decision making, they are like the kings, um wise council in in the background, but there's also, when it comes to ruling judgment on others that it was always like the king's role for years they start changing that adding women in that space and it was like I remember I had a case against me and it was literally the judge even said. She's like, oh, you caught me on a bad month. I just like, I'm just like, whoa, right. And it was just like all in relation to her cycle and things like that. like, I just became a I literally became a blood sacrifice for her fucking moon cycle. It's like, what the fuck? Anyway, all so, in the crux of it all so slowly wrap this out, get quickly, we create our non neggotiables, keep our word ourselves, and bring in honesty, so those are all self driven factors, driven by an understanding of the ego that the soul is telling it to do, and maybe the ego want some of it too, because it sees like, well, I could benefit better from this too. This would be better. I could have all the things I want. I could have my millions, I got my billions, I could have my bitches, I could have like whatever it is. There's gonna be all this little fucking things happen in the background. e goes the the right in the middle of that Yingy yang. Well, because it's right in the middle of the Ying and y. thegle it seems it's literally this is this is ego. where are you going at? This is ego. Where's the ginging guy? And he's right there in the center. And him running the center of this spinning white and black mass, the the fish how did you go to green again, you tricky those nicky, snicky, dicker? Right in the middle of that spinning vortex, and he's like the pin in the centerer. that ooh, ah, ooh, ah, I want these all these things, right? So, again, whatever, cool, be that. I appreciate that because now I can see all of the things that I also need to need to see. It's like the structure of the human body and the soul and the mind was all built like this for a reason, so now I could see that. Cool. Relationship of the soul come up with you non negotiables, keep them, do them, stick to them, no matter fucking what. It's it. That's that's gonna be something to help keep this guy in line and keep you the soul in charge sort of like a marionette master with a puppet. You know, you're just telling this thing what to do. You can separate yourself sometimes, even better if you can't and that's you being here now, and not being traveing the future of the past, whatever. you can go ahead and s map out your future a bit and see some things and get some desires and you know, bless thego on, you know, whatever sort of yinging gang that you wanna be on. I choose to be more delight side. I see the the balance of the other, but I feel that there's a there's an imbalance in this world right now, so that's why I'm choosing to be that and I'm I see myself in a completely different frequency. So, again, that's all the base level and maybe like a little level like if you wanna talk levels of like the 12 levels of consciousness we'll just call it 12 to keep it simple, then, you know, maybe level four to six. But how are you getting your real juice? How do you getting your real power? Where's your real power color color, right? So, my power is coming from God and my understanding of myself as being an embodiment of God. and all being God and all being the mixture of it all, and all being the matrix that we live in and all being the game that we play with ourselves to just be and regardless if that's right or wrong, I know that I don't run it all over maybe I do run it all, just not in this isolated form, you know? I could tell the whole ocean to move even just being one drop of water, one moleule in the water, but it doesn't mean I'm that on the whole ocean still. But I am. It's a funny game that we play with ourselves to hear and see and do these things, but all you need to do is talk to your higher self talk to that self that's higher. You'll know when you're being pulled in a manipulated direction or not, there's other higher yeah, there's other higher things out there when you're being driven in the direction of truth and you're being driven in the in the direction of something that's pulling on one of your lower vibrational ego factors like Shane Gil, fear, anger, and driving you to do something um corruptive, dark, dirty, and whatever. And some of it trust me, it will feel good because I've definitely been down that path. It will fucking feel great. and um but in the end, you you'll have grit in your teeth. There's like there's this satisfaction that you can get by by winning with a cheat coat, but there's when you're standing next to the man that won with no cheat codes you're not gonna feel so grave more. And that's I want to be the man that didn't win with any cheap clothes. I don't even like people talking about, oh, got the cheap code to be, this, this and this, people want the fucking easy out and comfort. like, if you want the easy out and comfort, don't come try this course, because it's not gonna be easy. like, you want something that's gonna challenge you and make you a better person, you want to be called out for all your bullshit, then welcome. You have made it. I want something that. Well, everyone can obtain something that's easy. Yeah, yeah. Everyone can have something that's easy. They can. and uh well, that's the most people want. They want convenience doors, convenience, convenience, convenience, convenience comfort, convenience comfort. That's all it's sold. Right? That's what's sold, that's okay. That's what's happening. I'm glad that it's there for them and I'm glad that I went through and I'm glad I could get to see all their suffer because we if it's not being seen, it's not being done, then where we haven't learned. Once we don't see it anymore, and once we see all those around us strive to be higher or better, frequency beings, we'll probably have already vibrated into a new frequency, a new realm, where where existing, not in the third dimension anymore, but we've literally vibrated ourselves into another dimension, and I've felt that other like doing Joepenscer walking meditations, like every step that I take, every breath and I take, I'm walking into a new reality. and I felt these like jolts like, whoa. I like, okay, maybe I'm at like level 3.9 right now. You? Like, you use upgrade your frequency, everything is sound, everything is life. But let's break off understanding again of the like down to the third dimension and get up in the higher dimensions. So we have someone understanding of the first to the third, then the fourth to the sixth, so it's all you need to do is talk to your higher self. so let me read this one little paragraph here. All you need to do is talk to your higher self. I would like to know I was sorry I would like to know you have permission to show me the truth of who I really am when you talk to your higher self and you ask your higher self, I would like to know, and you give it permission because if not there's a party eagle that's going to try like do everything you can to distract you and say no, and you owe your permission or I'm gonna give a I'm a block it I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do that. Like put your use your words as your power, give it permission to talk to you, because it wants the acknowledgegment it knows it has all authority over it can end your life, it could begin your life, it could do whatever you want your life as you are that life giver, and you are the life taker. so communicate with you like that like uh, healthy boundary. I would like to know and you have permission show me the truth of who I really am. and stay in that space with your eyes closed for a bit, and say that, give it permission and then hold that intention. and as your mind wonders, you say it again, and you give it permission, and you hold that intention, and you could to say it quicker doesn't even be all like you know, if you want to give it a little bit of emotion to like tell your mind no, like, it might help turn it off a little bit, you'll find something that feels good to you, but as long as you keep trying to hold that intention and hold that thought, you already gave the permission mean and mean the permission that you give. Sometimes you're just going to just say like, okay, go ahead. Like tell me. You know, like you might get a little bit. Yeah, but you might get a little bit of an answer, but give give that permission some some real intention also. and then everything that you need will find you. Is that Once you once you ask, I would like to know the truth of who I really am, I give you permission to show me the truth of who I really am. You say that behold a permission and you hold that intention, I like to do with my clothes that I'm not worry about distractions if I can't put some earplugs into, that really helps a lot. Everything you need will find you. Everything you need will find. It is crazy. The download that I start getting just after that saying it one time sometimes. Like they just start information to start on my little how I'm gonna solve this problem. I like, how am I gonna do this? I'm like information just starts fucking downloading. You're like I'm not like, get why didn't I have my recorder set? You might want to have a recorder set, especially with, you know, AI technology, people are so scared of it. You know look, don't be scared, silly, or don't be scared stupid, right because it's literally just an extension of yourself. It's not even smarter than you right now, and it's never actually going to be smarter than you. It only feels smarter than you because you're not choosing to advance yourself and be more connected with yourself and more connected with your true self and your higher self. It's the only reason why you feel that way. It's an extension to help you become your best self, or, like the other side of the ego may use it or the darkness may use it, it will be a side to take all of that energy from you and lock you in like the matrix like the movie, I guess you just suck all your energy right out of you. And uh close your eyes again, say that and know that everything will find you. Don't wander off, you will feel correctness and you will feel greatness. and then that when you start feeling those things, it just starts coming in. It just the downloads, and this is only gonna happen with that truth and honesty with yourself, and that's what we try to help build in this course that I'm creating here, and talking about with my friend O right now and figuring out some of that. and I'm gonna do another one I did one with Hayley earlier, I'm gonna do one, another one with uh her a little bit more controlled like thisc I kind of figured this out today. um this method I want to use to help embody this and embody this with other people. And um I wanted to go over um some of the downloads that I got. It's only a couple of lines from this last journal entry. Um I decided to use a an iPad notebook and use the color teal as my hands are color, so I was scroll right to this like red colored teal. So I've been stalling on having these vision boards and these other things I desire in my life and I and I live in a fucking shed in somebody's backyard is Hawai. And I always thought that was kind of funny because I always thought Jack Dorsey that owned Twitter the story was pretty great. He lived in a shed in Greg Kid's backyard, and he built Twitter back there. You know, isn't who he wants to be known. corrupted or not or whatever they do, just like kind of a funny story. and I look at my story now, I look at my little my desk in my corner how I'm growing and, you know, I didn't even ask for this information. It just after I asked this permission to know and hold that attention the answer I got was, I cannot have the things I desire because I am not being the things I desire. I cannot have the biggest things about being the thing you design is there people have to forgive they have to open up and they have to forgive the people, and they just do all these room all the things that get on their nerves, at the little things that go their nerves. oh, they're shut the door too loud or too hard, and from the little things to the big things, though that person flick their cigarette well on the ground for that person stole my core or whatever it is, that person broke my heart if they really want to move past this, they're gonna have to true sincerely for you, because not for particularly no, but this is not about this is not about them right now. This is about me and the answers that I was receiving.. I appreciate all those things. I know, I know. I like this goes for you. I' let go of those things. I don't give a fuck. I'm just like, wow, you go ropes that bind. Oh, I know. I'm like, you go be that. like, you go be that like, you know, I even hate having to come back and like Haley wants to ask me about my day, not to tell her something about my day. And then it was like, well, I just cut off this guy because he was acting like a fucking n XY Z pri. And I'm like, I communicate it in a in a like there's emotion in my tone because I'm I'm a a character, I'm a theatrical character. But I'm like in all reality, like I'm not bothered by it. I'm just like I'm just like, I'm happy that in the moment when he confronted me the way that he did that the vision that I saw of me slapping him and whipped dragging a mile aside, wasn't the reality that happened and that I just sat there and I witnessed that show and then I kind of laughed at it and I I didn't become enthralled in it and happy with it. So I the people that lied on me with my my original case, the cops that fucking smacked the fucking smacked me all myrians will flying out of my ears. Like, you know, like all the things that have happened to me, like I' I like all of those r my understand where people like that. I cannot have the things I desire because I am not being the things I desire. I'm not being honest with myself. It's about me just being honest with myself and me keeping my word. That's where this one the answer resonated with me. Why I not have these things Paul? get fucking realle yourself, get honest. What are you fucking up? What you missing out on? Have you even really wrote out your vision board that you you say you want these things? How much do you really want these things? Do you really desire them? Are you really embody them? Fuck. Okay, all right, I'm listening now. And then you start hearing the inner voice, listen and you're like, okay, it's almost like too much. I think that's why people run from it and people hide from it and they use the substances to drown it out. The next thing was, you being weak like your body, you are being weak like your body, as your body is weak as it comes to every little fucking yeah, like just stop being weak like your body, you're higher than your body, you're more powerful than your body, remember who you are. and then ask the main question, give permission present desire, let honesty roll through you feel it don't justify it then guide from internal? guide from internal awareness while you must be presently to day from now on ask this end that goes better back to the same thing. I was like it was it came to me and I was just like reaffirming it to myself like a little bit deeper of that process. So you're you're asking the main question. I would like to know and for you to show me the truth of who I really am, you have permission to show me please please show me like I'm tired of living like this and that's using your anger as love, like I'm angry at myself for being like this. I know it's like the sadness or the tears that might feel like they're building up behind the eyes of being that way, that is not a weakness, that's feeling your anger and then pushing it through into change. So you asked the main question, and then you give permission and you present your desires. Where are those in those of those will definitely start changing like, well, why am I not having the things that I want? Because I'm not having I'm not being those things. I'm not being to be honestly, I'm not seeing those things. I'm always trying to look for shortcuts, you know, I'm looking for just all those we're always looking for shortcuts. We're looking for that way. We don't need to. We can literally fucking map any of it up. and then don't justify, you're gonna have all the things this they're not gonna do don't fucking justify it. And uh right now I got ten things around in my head that I've been justifying that I need to let go. And uh I I don't want to be honest about. I'm honest with myself about them, and I know that I don't want to do it anymore, but I don't want to be honest with those that I do to, even if it's like some billing stuff with somebody or whatever, you know, I just like fuck, I don't wanna do it. Like, I know I got a fucking system in my head right now. I like, you know, I can make another hundred thousand real quick if I if I do it like this, right? I don't need to fucking do that, because I'm better than that, and I can see something, and I don't wanna be the old fucking consciousness, like most of the men in our few periods generations have been. It's like just sell somebody sell them with them to sell somebody something that they don't even fucking need, just so you can have what you want. Right? Like, no. That's why I've stayed away from a lot of this content creator shit and that. Do your calling, not your desire, unsure, ask internally and sit with it. than that of calling to like draw this like a wave, like an ocean wave, like aquarius it like water, but then also a frequency wave. And then and then that became, how can I use symbols to write my being into matter? And then I sit with this guy today and I do this talk that I was tellingailey about about the organization stuff, and he's starts he pulls up his avatar in his computer that he's been designing for a couple of years. and he's like, yeah, I fucking put these like, AR glass on and a head my pen and I went, I got this really big board home. and I was like super deep. I'm like really using it. I feel like I'm carving out like this guy's like outfit out of clay. It's like this thing and like he puts commands in it where he can like make it like he's waving VR, like he can make his body stretch like really long like loom over people and he's a really badass holds like mind rave DJ sets, right for people. and then, um he can make his as a bald head, but he could like make bro hair or do weird things and just you know glasses like created a cartoon avatar character. But then he started talking about how can I use symbols to write my being in a matter? He said I'm like, well, what what's this on his arm? It's like these symbols. And he's like, oh, that's like I could I could be different people around different things and be different like, huh? He's like, yeah, like so I have all these different you know, presentatious, like whenever I go into a certain whirl around, like I am literally seen as a different character, or I am this person or that. And then that fucking podcast comes up I don't know if I send me that one with a laser that being to you. dude's looking into a laser, he was told by the entities to start doing this, and he start seeing time and matter as we are now at the matrix. Like you start to see like all these little gears spitting, and you' like looking at later you to see all these little gear spinning and he's had many people doing this a very controlled, like, you just do it. like we're not gonna tell you what to see or anything, but you'll start seeing this, and all of a sudden that these numbers start to appear like the matrix and the falling down and going up and you're like, what the fuck do you sort to see like through the wall into the next room? And you're like, whoa. And then I'm like with the rainbow. Yeah, like something like a rainbow, but more. It's so it you you feel something so much. Rambo just like, wow, reality is weird. This is like whoa, I am like, I am it. Like I it's like this I am understanding. And then once you have certain levels of understanding, you you know, you you're frequency comes to another channel is channel now for him when he smokes DMT, he has like you remember the minority record? It's on Thursday like the blue, like clear holographic screens. I pop up around on it. He basically has something like that, like a work table that like pops up. as he's just walking around, it just like floats within it for like 20 minutes. and he's walking around and he sees all these things happening in the world around him that are like in the matrix. He's just like an operator, right? And he sees these these like aliens and entities, like if another human smokes DNT and they come flying into like the DMT world, an alien will like grab them out the air as they're flying, and then pop some goggles on them, they're like, and then they go back and they have their trip. And then he came to this understanding after communicating with them, that was like, we do this to them because they're not ready. They just came here to play. We just do this and distract them until they're ready for the next world, the next saying the world. I was like,W fucking eh, sounds trippy, but when I started doing deems, it wasn't until I got home and I started doing it after my lost ceremony that I started having, you know, surrounded by aliens, it was like whoa, I like doing it and then they're like see through skin look like universe and like white cloaks and like. And like going in me like, no, 20 years out me. and then on Iuasi was like, is like little creatures like contorting me, like, holding then my body was't hurting over again for like, for a while, it was like they were like heavy me all these weird lock positions and like, why are you holding it like that? And I'm like, oh, you're helping me to get rid of something like, you twisting the knots and like like wring a towel, but there was like, oh, oh, the elf like, like, okay. you know? But they were like ringing me out and how this big blue arms and I kind of like shake me from my gosh, you know? and all these crazy things like that, it was like, well, I was nuts, but I was like, the oops. frequency. I was seeing these DNA aliens for a while and they did all this healing for me and I was like, huh, okay. where does Jesus come in this? mean? So you start seeing all these different realms realities, so you start reading some of the old books that they took out of the Bible again, it's like the old lost books, where Jesus talks about going through different dimensions and levels, so like coming back down here and then going back up, like descending again. She's like, well, what are you ascending? They're not just going in the clouds, right into the sky, right? It's like, what is this idea? And then you start looking at the shockers. The cabal is the DNA strand stuff and you start to see the matrix that we live in not not even just a matrix, but a even in the Bible, as aollow of the stars, you know, for that is like your thing, like, um how how does it say again directly? Hey Siri, hey Siri. hey Siri oh I guess you don't wanna work because I am recording fine. follow the stars boat in the Bible The Bible passches that describes the following the stars is Matthew Wont told, which tells the story of Maggie or Wisman who followed the star, neither something else. and when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars, and all the heavenly array, do not be enticed by bowing down to them It's And those who are wise shall shin like the brightness of the sky above, and those who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever, and those who are wise are sound like the brightness of the sky above, and those who turn may righteous like the stars for forever and ever like that ever expanding universe, we go, the color, the brightness, there's something else so there's another one like don't bow down to them, but look at them to see the patterns of this existence. like, remember who you are. They don't they talk about the 12 constellations, but they don't talk about the third 13 constellation, and I can't remember from his or not, but it is like there's all these things like have been manipulated over time so like hide us from remembering ourselves. It's like how fast are we supposed to remember ourselves? I we're supposed to go through this evolution of time and suffering to to come to an understanding because this isn't our final destination. This is just one of the many that we live to entertain ourselves. and that can become daunting and kind of loose hope in life.yle. I I've lost hope in my. I know the people that have. I met another friend that kind of lost hope. There was love to light around and just get high all the time, it doesn't really, you know, it works like a little bit of a job and it just like loves to talk about all these esoteric things like experience them, but it just like what am I to change anything for? What am I to be this for? It's like just to experience this like, am I supposed to be the light in this character? am I supposed to be this character? Like what you what you your ego for? What is your why do you feel like your your character was here? You know, if you're feeling depressed or you're feeling out of one one, probably because you're character is not being the avatar that is supposed to be there, right now? You're just doing something because you're. it's like a pattern that're stuck in it., you break that pattern and then become that itself. Okay, that's all for today, that's all for today. Thanks for listening and to I guess I'll just call it my first podcast. Yeah
